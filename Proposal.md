Prior Art: Everything is built based on a collection of other experiences. Your project proposal should describe your project's relationship to other similar projects. This should compare and contrast your proposed project with two other similar projects.

Core User Workflows: Your project proposal should describe the core user workflows that your project should support. This should give more specific details on exactly what you plan to build. Just as importantly, it will give insight into what you are not building.

Project Timeline: Your project proposal should outline your weekly development goals and who is responsible for those goals (if more than one person is on your team). These goals should be described in terms of your core user workflows. They should also be simple to validate.

Technologies: You should list what technologies you plan to use to complete your project and include a link to the Github repository that has been setup for your project.

Project Description and Motivation:
Greg and I are planning on making a website for creating pokémon and hosting them alongside pokedexes to store them in. This means that a user can create pokémon and keep track of them using their own public/private pokedex. Users will also be able to collaborate on their pokédexes through invitations sent by the creator. The reason we decided to take on this project was to build upon our first unit project regarding a pokémon database, and to add more user focused content for convient hosting of custom pokémon. Not only will this allow us to show our growth from our beginning, but this will also allow us to work on more user generated content and it's proper maintenance.

Prior Art: References ([Official Pokémon Pokédex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/), [Similar "create a pokémon Website"](https://www.smogon.com/cap/pokemon/))
Our prior art is based off the offical pokémon pokédex which is used in pretty much anything Pokémon. Much like the site linked we'll have a page for viewing the pokémon and possibly the pokédex thier apart of. For the second link, Smogon, we have a similar concept by being able to create pokémon on the site, but our site will allow for more general creation than the linked one. The Smogon webiste Was made and used by professional teams instead of the public, but our will be more focused on a public use case.

Core User Workflow: 
The workflow of the user is, They begin on a landing page with a "Sign Up" and "Login" button as well has a pathway to view the top 100 public Pokémon. After the user signs in or creates an account they have an extra prompt to create a Pokémon or a Pokédex. In the Pokédex the user can decide if the Pokédex is public or private. If it is public the Pokédex will be viewable on the users profile page, otherwise it will only be viewable by the creator. In a private Pokédex the creator is able to invite other users to add Pokémon to the Pokédex. Only the creator of a Pokédex can delete the entire Pokédex, but all the Pokémon created by a user will be seen on their own page in a private tab unless they decide to make the Pokémon public.
